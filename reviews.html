        <h3><span class="stars">★★★★★</span> Best portable air pump I’ve ever owned!</h3>
        <p class="content">The PortaPump is an absolute lifesaver! I’ve taken it on road trips,
             camping, and even used it to quickly inflate my bike tires. The fact that I can also
              charge my phone is such a great bonus. Definitely a must have for anyone on the go!</p>

        <h3><span class="stars">★★★★☆</span> Great product, needs a little work</h3>
        <p class="content"> PortaPump is a great product don't get me wrong, but I feel it doesn't have as much power as it advertises. It's great when you need to
            fill up your kid's ball but aside from that, car tires take ages. It would be better to call insurance and get a tire replacement.

        <h3><span class="stars">★★★★★</span> Amazing for travel!</h3>
        <p class="content"> Wow, my friends and I all love PortaPump! We travel to the beach a lot and play a lot of volleyball. This was an amazing tool to help us take 
            more balls while conserving space in our car. We ended up bringing many deflated balls and we would just pump them up on arrival. Not to forget how small it 
            is; we saved even more space!

        <h3><span class="stars">★★★★★</span> Life. Saver.</h3>
        <p class="content"> PortaPump, THANK YOU. My family was stranded when we went camping due to a flat car tire. We brought your product mainly to pump up lake inflatables, but
            did not expect to get a flat on our way back home. Thankfully, we had a PortaPump to pump our tire up and get us home safely!
