                <p>Nobody likes waiting for their products, that's why we make it our priority to get your package shipped and delivered to you as fast as possible. 
                Here at PortaPump, we ensure your product will get to you in two days. With our new method of double shipping, we ship two products to you so if something happens 
                to one, the other will come on time. The best thing is, the product that didn't make it in time will be automatically transferred to a warehouse in that area. 
                Disclaimer: You will only receive one product; two are shipped in order to make sure you receive the product in time.</p>

                <p>If you were not satisfied with our product, or your product came damaged, we offer full refunds transferred immediately to your bank account. 
                We also offer an exchange for the possibly defective product, or a test of our Beta Products such as GoVac and PortaPumpV2.</p>
